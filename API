This app provides REST api over HTTP.

Installation instructions are in INSTALL file.

For clients to be able to access API - keys need to be created.
Go to the Django admin interface http://<hostname>/admin and add API key.

When making request API key should be provided by the client with every
request in APIKey HTTP header.

By default all dates are in UTC timezone. Using optional TZ HTTP header another
timezone can be selected for lookup/output dates. It is highly advised to use
this feature, because it converts all dates correctly, according to
historical timezone database.

Now, given you have aggregated IP history database filled with some data you 
can test it from commandline:

curl -H "APIKey: <Your-API-Key-Here>" -H "TZ: <Timezone>" http://<hostname>/apiv1/ip/A.B.C.D/"
or
curl -H "APIKey: <Your-API-Key-Here>" -H "TZ: <Timezone>" "http://<hostname>/apiv1/ip/A.B.C.D/YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss/"
or
curl -H "APIKey: <Your-API-Key-Here>" -H "TZ: <Timezone>" "http://<hostname>/apiv1/mac/xxxxxxxxxxxx/"
or
curl -H "APIKey: <Your-API-Key-Here>" -H "TZ: <Timezone>" "http://<hostname>/apiv1/mac/xxxxxxxxxxxx/YYYY:MM:DD hh:mm:ss/"

Should return JSON encoded object(s) of the following format:

{
"giaddr": "A.B.C.D",
"end": "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss",
"circuit_id": "vendor-and-config-dependent-string",
"remote_id": "vendor-and-config-dependent-string",
"start": "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss",
"mac": "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
"ip": "A.B.C.D",
"tz": "UTC"
}

Examples:

curl -H "APIKey: bla-bla-bla-key" -H "TZ: Europe/Vilnius" "http://localhost/apiv1/ip/192.168.0.5/2013-01-15 23:00:01/"

curl -H "APIKey: 2345235235235235" -H "TZ: UTC" "http://localhost/apiv1/mac/00deadbeef00/"
